<p>
My name is Evan Douglas. I really getting swole and eating nothing but pasta and tacos.
</p>

<p>
At MSOE, I learned all about the "big picture" of software systems. I learned design patterns, architecture, low-level coding concepts, high-level concepts,
and plenty of actual software development. 
</p>
<p>
Even with the wide variety of coursework, the greatest thing I learned at MSOE was actually <i>how to learn</i>.
I say this, because there is no way to learn everything about the software world, but MSOE did its best to keep pushing me past my perceived limitations. 
I was constantly being thrown into new concepts, which proved to be a great way to grow myself as a software engineer. After 4 years at MSOE, I will never want to stop learning and experimenting.
