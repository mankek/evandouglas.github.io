I have played disc golf since middle school, and have always loved it (except for those days when you keep hitting trees). I quickly got involved in the MSOE Disc Golf club when I first got to MSOE, and it was such a great club with a lot of great people. My sophomore year, I filled the role of treasurer, then Vice President. I then became the President of the club for my Junior and Senior years of college.

The club hosts a "re-engineering" tournament in Milwaukee about every year, which brings good involvement in the community. We also try to network with local disc golfers as much as we can.

One of the things that we are most proud of is our political involvement with the Milwaukee County Budget. Every year, we go to the budget hearings and fight for an amendment which states "funds from disc golf must be used for the benefit of disc golf". This brings comfort to local disc golfers, because they know that the money they spend when playing will be used to improve the sport in Milwaukee County.

<p>
That amendment has directly benefited us, because we are currently working on a course design at the Milwaukee County Sports Complex. This is a large project, and we are extremely happy that the Parks Department reached out to us. This is likely due to our involvement in volunteer days at the local parks, and our activity within the community.

I am proud to have been a leader of this club, and have enjoyed all of my involvement with this club.
