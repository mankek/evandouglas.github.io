<p>
Other than Disc Golf and Video Games, I also really enjoy lifting weights, relaxing and reading a book, woodburning/pyrography, and hanging out with my friends.
</p>
<p>
I also really enjoy puns and dad-jokes, but I will spare you from hearing any of them...
</p>

<p>Wood burning is a fairly new hobby to me but I am working to get better, and have made a few projects that I have hung up in my room.</p>
