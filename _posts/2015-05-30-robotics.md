Even though this is an experience from High School, it deserves a mention. FIRST robotics offers a great experience that will bring a unique experience to High School students, as well as providing lifelong memories. My junior year of high school, my team (Rock N' Robots) won the Lake Superior regional competition and had the privilege to compete in the World Competition.
