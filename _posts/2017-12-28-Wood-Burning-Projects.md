# First Wood Burning Projects

I first received a practice wood-burning kit when I was a young kid. Naturally, I didn't stick to the hobby, because I didn't have the patience to learn as a kid.

Now that I live on my own, I was looking for some wall decorations, so I decided to get into wood-burning (seriously this time). 

## First Project
One of my favorite games is Skyrim. I looked to this for inspiration, because designing from my favorite game would make the project more fun. 

My first thought was of the civil war in Skyrim, and I typically lean towards the Stormcloaks (Skyrim belongs to the Nords!). As an additional benefit, their flag has a very simple design on it (shown below).

As a first project, this bear design would be fairly simple (as it does not require shading)

## Second Project
I have always been interested in Norse Mythology, and two of the most iconic symbols from Norse Mythology are Huginn and Muninn. 
They are Odin's two ravens, and there are many different designs to visualize them. I chose the one that looked coolest to me, yet still looked possible for a beginner project.
