      <h3>MSOE</h3>

      <p>
        The Milwaukee School of Engineering is a great private engineering university. They have a specialized Software Engineering Program that offers hands-on, practical experience. This prepares MSOE students for jobs in the industry.

      <h3>Video Games</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, as a Software Engineer, I have a few video games that I really enjoy. Some of my favorites include: the Civilization series, The Elder Scrolls series, and the Fallout series.

      <h3>FIRST Robotics</h3>

      <p>
        Even though this is an experience from High School, it deserves a mention. FIRST robotics offers a great experience that will bring a unique experience to High School students, as well as providing lifelong memories. My junior year of high school, my team (Rock N' Robots) won the Lake Superior regional competition and had the privilege to compete in the World Competition.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Other than Disc Golf and Video Games, I also really enjoy lifting weights, relaxing and reading a book, woodburning/pyrography, and hanging out with my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also really enjoy puns and dad-jokes, but I will spare you from hearing any of them...

        <h2>Welcome To Evan's Page</h2>
        <p>
          This is my first time developing a personal website. It will highlight some of my software experience, as well as some of my hobbies. The goal of this page is to be professional, while still allowing people to get to know me. If you are looking for purely professional information, go to the "CV" tab or explore my LinkedIn page (link at bottom).

        <h3>Disc Golf</h3>
        <img class="float-top" src="site-assets/images/DiscGolfClub.jpg" width="510" height="150" alt="">
        <p>
          I have played disc golf since middle school, and have always loved it (except for those days when you keep hitting trees). I quickly got involved in the MSOE Disc Golf club when I first got to MSOE, and it was such a great club with a lot of great people. My sophomore year, I filled the role of treasurer, then Vice President. I then became the President of the club for my Junior and Senior years of college.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club hosts a "re-engineering" tournament in Milwaukee about every year, which brings good involvement in the community. We also try to network with local disc golfers as much as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the things that we are most proud of is our political involvement with the Milwaukee County Budget. Every year, we go to the budget hearings and fight for an amendment which states "funds from disc golf must be used for the benefit of disc golf". This brings comfort to local disc golfers, because they know that the money they spend when playing will be used to improve the sport in Milwaukee County.
        </p>
        <p>
          That amendment has directly benefited us, because we are currently working on a course design at the Milwaukee County Sports Complex. This is a large project, and we are extremely happy that the Parks Department reached out to us. This is likely due to our involvement in volunteer days at the local parks, and our activity within the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proud to have become a leader of this club, and have enjoyed all of my involvement with this club.
